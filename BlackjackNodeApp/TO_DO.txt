BUCKET
- make requests synchronous so they run before new actions are performed -- Don't do this 
- return multiple objects in one request so you don't have to mke multiple requests
- create ordered array in js and store in scope variable so ng-each could be used to clean up code in html 
- create Stats generic class and derive statsCC and statsFast from it
